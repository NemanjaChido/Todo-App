## Overview

Todo app built with javascript library: React.js and styled with Tailwind css. In the app, each section of the UI is being rendered with individual piece of react component that includes; Todolist, Todo, Input. The app allows users to create, delete, mark tasks as complete, drag and rearrange task and navigate between ALL/ACTIVE and COMPLETED section, Thus providing a simple and intuitive interface for task management.

## The Challenge
Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### What I learned

As someone who's still on that journey of learing React, wrapping up this Todo app (using hooks like useState for task lists, event handlers for add/edit/delete, and conditional rendering for completed items), and using the .map() method to loop over the tasks array and render each as a component, with unique key props to help React efficiently update the DOM was exciting. I enjoyed the fact that i was exposed me to working with react hooks like useState and useEffects to Show/hide elements when needed, strikethrough text for completed tasks when toggled and also store the data in local storage depending on how and when todo tasks are added or updated.


### Continued development

-Current State: it uses useState for task management, which is sufficient for a small-scale app but may become cumbersome with complex features.
-Current Code: My appâ€™s codebase is functional but may include repetitive logic or tightly coupled components.
Transition to a more scalable solution is necessary, thus, suggestions will be greatly appreciated
